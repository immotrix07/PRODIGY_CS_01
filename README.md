# PRODIGY_CS_01
This Python program implements a Caesar Cipher tool for encrypting and decrypting text, allowing users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption or decryption. The program shifts each letter by a user-defined number of positions in the alphabet while preserving non-alphabetic characters, ensuring the original message's structure is maintained. This tool demonstrating basic encryption principles, or for simple security applications where lightweight encryption is sufficient. Users can easily encrypt and decrypt messages with customizable shift values through a user-friendly interface.
